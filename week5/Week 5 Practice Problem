## Problem 1
# Using the "1976-2020-president.csv" data set, write a function that allows the user to get total votes cast for a
# specific person in a specific state in a specific year.
# Bonus, also include the percentage of the total vote that that candidate got by state and year.

# hint use input(), nested for loops, elif series, and df.loc[]
# don't forget input() takes inputs as string data types, and don't forget cases sensitivity
# your default arguments for your function can be set to None
